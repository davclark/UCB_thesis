This truth effect can be measured in two ways: (a) as the increase in subjective truth from the first to the second encounter (within-items criterion) and (b) as the difference in truth ratings between repeated and other new statements (between-items criterion). Qualitative differences are assumed between the processes underlying both criteria. A meta-analysis of the truth effect was conducted that compared the two criteria. In all, 51 studies of the repetition-induced truth effect were included in the analysis. Results indicate that the between-items effect is larger than the within-items effect. Moderator analyses reveal that several moderators affect both effects differentially. This lends support to the notion that different psychological comparison processes may underlie the two effects. The results are discussed within the processing fluency account of the truth effect.},

involved 55 first-year journalism graduate students, our {“Numbers}, News, and Evidence” 
module, 4.5 classroom hours, 20 homework hours, and several  (e.g., Pre-, Mid- and Final- 
test) assessments. Post-module findings indicate success: Relative to control data, the 
experimental group improved on the main numeracy measures: 1) estimation accuracy and 2) 
math competence involving simple problem solving, data analyses, and exponential growth. 
Students and faculty both concluded that future students should also receive numeracy 
modules.  The module apparently influenced students’ attitudes about numerical information, 
too.  The collective results may benefit journalists, their instructors, and media consumers.},

attitude, scientific conceptual change, social cognition, and
judgment and decision making, we offer results from a para-
digm we call Numerically-Driven Inferencing (Ranney,
Cheng, Nelson, \& Garcia de Osuna, 2001). {NDI} includes ob-
serving the effects of presenting critical, germane, and credi-
ble base rates that are relevant to social policies; such data, we
found, can catalyze changes in belief systems. Here, 130
college students first estimated quantities relevant to impor-
tant policy issues (e.g., abortion rates), then stated preferences
for these values. They next received the true values as feed-
back, and were again asked for their preferences. This {EPIC}
(Estimate, Prefer, Incorporate-feedback, \& Change-policy)
method helps quantify relationships among one's understand-
ings of base rates and policies. As some have noted, we too
found that people are often poor at estimating base rates.
Going beyond past research, we further found that many are
quite surprised by the true base rates, and readily revise their
numerical preferences after receiving them. Preference
changes seem surprise-mediated and are often actual policy
shifts (which go beyond the mere re-scaling of preferences in
proportion to the feedback). The shifts suggest that conceptual
changes among a network of propositions gave rise to belief
revisions. We also found that abortion rates queried in differ-
ent ways yielded notably different policies and policy
changes. {EPIC} may be used to improve numeracy, so we also
discuss an {NDI} curriculum that engages younger people; it
may allow us to further consider how numerical cognition and
preference co-develop.},

one of its methods, {EPIC} (Estimate, Prefer, Incorporate, and

effects of numeric feedback on one’s personal policies

92 undergraduates offered estimates and preferences for the
legal {U.S.} abortion rate, explaining and justifying them. After
receiving the (usually, quite surprising) true rate as feedback,
they provided another (typically changed) preference-and-
rationale. Results show that people vastly underestimated the
abortion rate, and largely advocated decreases in it––both pre-
and post-feedback. Feedback caused most of those who
initially wanted no change in the abortion rate both to
abandon the status quo and change preference-justifications;
after feedback, two thirds of these students preferred a rate
decrease, while the rest preferred an increase. Although many
researchers hold that belief revision and conceptual change
are quite difficult to elicit, these and other results show
dramatic effects of simple base rate feedback on policy
evaluation. Our findings highlight the importance of having
and using data when reasoning about society-engaging topics
such as abortion rates. This experiment represents a new way
to study numerically-based reasoning that includes the
subjective natures of our personal beliefs and social lives.},

	abstract = {Novel word learning is central to the flexibility inherent in the human language capacity. Word learning may partially depend on long-term memory formation during the assembly of phonological representations from orthographic inputs. In the present study, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI)} examined the contributions of phonological control-a component of the verbal working memory system-to phonological assembly and word learning. Subjects were scanned while making syllable decisions about visually presented familiar (English) and novel (pseudo-English and Foreign) words, a task that required retrieval and analysis of existing phonological codes or the assembly and analysis of novel representations. Results revealed that left inferior prefrontal cortex ({LIPC)} and bilateral parietal cortices were differentially engaged during the processing of novel words, suggesting that this circuit is recruited during phonological assembly. A subsequent memory analysis that examined the relation between {fMRI} signal and the subject's ability to later remember the words (a measure of effective memory formation) revealed that the magnitude of activation in {LIPC}, bilateral superior parietal, and left inferior parietal cortices was positively correlated with later memory. Moreover, although the magnitude of the subsequent memory effect in parietal cortex was not significantly affected by word type, this effect was greater in posterior {LIPC} for novel (pseudo-English) than for familiar (English) words. In the course of subserving the assembly of novel word representations, the phonological (articulatory) control component of the phonological system appears to play a central role in the encoding of novel words into long-term memory.},

We now report, however, that systems consolidation can occur extremely quickly if an associative "schema" into which new information is incorporated has previously been created. In experiments using a hippocampal-dependent paired-associate task for rats, the memory of flavor-place associations became persistent over time as a putative neocortical schema gradually developed. New traces, trained for only one trial, then became assimilated and rapidly hippocampal-independent. Schemas also played a causal role in the creation of lasting associative memory representations during one-trial learning. The concept of neocortical schemas may unite psychological accounts of knowledge structures with neurobiological theories of systems memory consolidation.},

	abstract = {The relationship between implicit and explicit processes during motor learning, and for visuomotor adaptation in particular, is poorly understood. We set up a conflict between implicit and explicit processes by instructing subjects to counter a visuomotor rotation using a cognitive strategy in a pointing task. Specifically, they were told the exact nature of the directional perturbation, a rotation that directed them 45degrees counterclockwise from the desired target, and they were instructed to counter it by aiming for the neighboring clockwise target, 45degrees away. Subjects were initially successful in completely negating the rotation with this strategy. Surprisingly, however, they were unable to sustain explicit control and made increasingly large errors to the desired target. The cognitive strategy failed because subjects simultaneously adapted unconsciously to the rotation to the neighboring target. Notably, the rate of implicit adaptation to the neighboring target was not significantly different from rotation adaptation in the absence of an opposing explicit strategy. These results indicate that explicit strategies cannot substitute for implicit adaptation to a visuomotor rotation and are in fact overridden by the motor planning system. This suggests that the motor system requires that planned and executed trajectories remain congruous in visual space, and enforces this correspondence even at the expense of an opposing explicit task goal. {10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5317-05.2006}},

We present evidence that the conflict between these two concepts can occur automatically, such that increasing the perceived value of one decreases the automatic evaluation of the other. In Experiment 1, scientific theories described as poor explanations decreased automatic evaluations of science, but simultaneously increased automatic evaluations of God. In Experiment 2, using God as an explanation increased automatic evaluations of God, but decreased automatic evaluations of science. Religion and science both have the potential to be ultimate explanations, and these findings suggest that this competition for explanatory space can create an automatic opposition in evaluations.},

attitude, scientific conceptual change, social cognition, and
judgment and decision making, we offer results from a para-
digm we call Numerically-Driven Inferencing (Ranney,
Cheng, Nelson, \& Garcia de Osuna, 2001). {NDI} includes ob-
serving the effects of presenting critical, germane, and credi-
ble base rates that are relevant to social policies; such data, we
found, can catalyze changes in belief systems. Here, 130
college students first estimated quantities relevant to impor-
tant policy issues (e.g., abortion rates), then stated preferences
for these values. They next received the true values as feed-
back, and were again asked for their preferences. This {EPIC}
(Estimate, Prefer, Incorporate-feedback, \& Change-policy)
method helps quantify relationships among one's understand-
ings of base rates and policies. As some have noted, we too
found that people are often poor at estimating base rates.
Going beyond past research, we further found that many are
quite surprised by the true base rates, and readily revise their
numerical preferences after receiving them. Preference
changes seem surprise-mediated and are often actual policy
shifts (which go beyond the mere re-scaling of preferences in
proportion to the feedback). The shifts suggest that conceptual
changes among a network of propositions gave rise to belief
revisions. We also found that abortion rates queried in differ-
ent ways yielded notably different policies and policy
changes. {EPIC} may be used to improve numeracy, so we also
discuss an {NDI} curriculum that engages younger people; it
may allow us to further consider how numerical cognition and
preference co-develop.},

Although the medial temporal lobe (which includes the hippocampus and surrounding perirhinal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal cortices) is known to be crucial for recognition memory, controversy remains regarding how the specific subregions within the medial temporal lobe contribute to recognition. We used event-related functional {MRI} to examine the relation between activation in distinct medial temporal lobe subregions during memory formation and the ability (i) to later recognize an item as previously encountered (item recognition) and (ii) to later recollect specific contextual details about the prior encounter (source recollection). Encoding activation in hippocampus and in posterior parahippocampal cortex predicted later source recollection, but was uncorrelated with item recognition. In contrast, encoding activation in perirhinal cortex predicted later item recognition, but not subsequent source recollection. These outcomes suggest that the subregions within the medial temporal lobe subserve distinct, but complementary, learning mechanisms.},

documented conceptual changes related to policy issues when
one receives a single, critical number. In the present study,
Experiment 1 uses a Numerically-Driven Inferencing ({NDI)}
paradigm method in which participants estimated policy-
relevant quantities, learned the true quantities, and rated their
surprise regarding that feedback. When asked to recall the
quantities either eight or 84 days post-feedback, participants
improved the most over their original estimates on items that
surprised them the most. In Experiment 2, we found that a
measure of prospective surprise (“shock”; Ranney, Cheng,
Nelson, \& Garcia de Osuna, 2001)—derived from an interval
in which participants believed the number fell, and
participants’ confidence that the number fell in that interval—
reliably predicted retrospective surprise ratings like those in
Experiment 1. We conclude that surprise is a rather stable
construct about which people have considerable
metacognition. Future work in this area may suggest how
leaders, voters, and consumers can best employ their
emotional responses to numbers and enhance cognitive
strategies that help shape effective policies.},

	abstract = {This article tests 2 competing explanations for the truth effect, the finding that repeated statements are believed more than new statements. Previous research has put forth 2 explanations for this effect—subjective familiarity and perceived source variability. The subjective familiarity explanation holds that repeated statements feel more familiar and are therefore believed more than new statements. This explanation has received strong support in the literature. The source variability explanation holds that people attribute repeated statements to different sources; this belief, that multiple sources endorse the statement, increases belief in repeated statements relative to new statements attributed to a single source. However, previous studies testing this explanation have confounded source variability with source credibility. This research aims to tease apart the effects of subjective familiarity and source variability while holding source credibility constant across conditions. Results of the first 2 experiments manipulating number of sources and measuring recognition implicate subjective familiarity rather than perceived source variability as the mechanism underlying the truth effect. However, the third study demonstrates that source variability does enhance belief in repeated statements that are initially perceived as low in plausibility. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. [{ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

In this way regularities associated with attitude change and persuasion are interpreted as evidence of a deliberative process, involving negotiation and the use of supporting and opposing arguments.

Reporting emotional responses to the story before or after making probative value judgments had no effect on the probative value judgments. In Experiment 2, rationally activated individuals reported less intense emotions than those who were activated experientially by listing emotions experienced by the story’s victim. Rational system activation also significantly reduced estimates of the problem’s seriousness and victimization risk relative to both those who were experientially activated and those who were not explicitly activated. The asymmetrical impact of the rational and experiential systems on affective and cognitive judgments is discussed in terms of the dynamic interaction between the two processing systems.},

In particular, do citizens make distinctions concerning the relevance and civility of campaign messages? If so, do citizens' views about the relevance and civility of negative messages influence how they evaluate candidates? We rely on an experimental research design embedded in a public opinion survey to examine people's reactions to negative commercials. Based on a national survey of nearly 700 respondents, we find citizens differentiate between negative advertisements in meaningful and consistent ways. Furthermore, the civility and relevance of the negative commercials significantly influences people's evaluations of the targeted candidates in several ways, including trait, affect, and issue evaluations.},

We used data from the Monitoring the Future survey in a pre/post quasi-experimental design to relate trends in youth smoking prevalence to varied doses of the "truth" campaign in a national sample of approximately 50000 students in grades 8, 10, and 12, surveyed each spring from 1997 through 2002. Results. Findings indicate that the campaign accounted for a significant portion of the recent decline in youth smoking prevalence. We found that smoking prevalence among all students declined from 25.3\% to 18.0\% between 1999 and 2002 and that the campaign accounted for approximately 22\% of this decline. Conclusions. This study showed that the campaign was associated with substantial declines in youth smoking and has accelerated recent declines in youth smoking prevalence.},

A large survey of {U.S.} adults (N = 1540) found little support for this account. On the whole, the most scientifically literate and numerate subjects were slightly less likely, not more, to see climate change as a serious threat than the least scientifically literate and numerate ones. More importantly, greater scientific literacy and numeracy were associated with greater cultural polarization: Respondents predisposed by their values to dismiss climate change evidence became more dismissive, and those predisposed by their values to credit such evidence more concerned, as science literacy and numeracy increased. We suggest that this evidence reflects a conflict between two levels of rationality: The individual level, which is characterized by citizens’ effective use of their knowledge and reasoning capacities to form risk perceptions that express their cultural commitments; and the collective level, which is characterized by citizens’ failure to converge on the best available scientific evidence on how to promote their common welfare. Dispelling this, “tragedy of the risk-perception commons,” we argue, should be understood as the central aim of the science of science communication.},

The serial reaction time ({SRT)} task is used to probe how people learn sequences of actions, while adaptation in the context of visuomotor or force field perturbations serves to illustrate how preexisting movements are recalibrated in novel environments. These tasks highlight important issues regarding the representational changes that occur during the course of motor learning. One important theme is that distinct mechanisms vary in their information processing costs during learning and performance. Fast learning processes may require few trials to produce large changes in performance but impose demands on cognitive resources. Slower processes are limited in their ability to integrate complex information but minimally demanding in terms of attention or processing resources. The representations derived from fast systems may be accessible to conscious processing and provide a relatively greater measure of flexibility, while the representations derived from slower systems are more inflexible and automatic in their behavior. In exploring these issues, we focus on how multiple neural systems may interact and compete during the acquisition and consolidation of new behaviors.},

We also explored older adults’ beliefs as a possible source of the children’s ideas. In Study 2, we gave 3rd- and 4th-grade Chinese children either a conventional cold/flu education program or an experimental {“Think} Biology” program that focused on a biological causal mechanism for cold/flu transmission. The {“Think} Biology” program led children to reason about cold/flu causation and prevention more scientifically than the conventional program, and their reasoning abilities dovetailed with their mastery of the causal mechanism. Study 3, a modified replication of Study 2, found useful behavioral change as well as conceptual change among children who received the {“Think} Biology” program and documented coherence among knowledge enrichment, conceptual change, and behavioral change.},

	abstract = {Conceptual change represents a crucial, challenging, learning component. This study 
hypothesized and observed evidence for two parallel forms of learning within the Numerically-Driven 
Inferencing ({NDI)} paradigm’s rather minimalist intervention of providing direct feedback regarding a 
numerical estimate––feedback that yields remarkably robust cognitive alterations. The present 
experiment probed the nature of learning apropos recall or estimation improvements observed after 
participants (a) provided estimates, (b) received feedback, and (c) re-estimated after waiting for one 
day. The results show that improved estimation/recall was predicted by two independent elements–– 
surprise at feedback and an explicit sense of episodic recall upon testing. This suggests at least two 
learning processes: (1) an explicit (though perhaps approximate) recollection of a quantity’s magnitude 
and (2) a non-episodic semantic restructuring that correlates with surprise. Thus, even for concise, 
factual information, we educators might consider students’ “unknown knowns”––knowledge that 
learners gain without any explicit understanding that they have done so.},

They were tested both 1 hr and 7 days later for recognition of words encountered in the study list and their ability to complete graphemic word fragments. Performance on the fragment-completion task was primed (facilitated) by the appearance of the target words in the earlier list. The observed priming effects were independent of recognition memory in 2 ways: (1) although recognition accuracy was greatly diminished over the 7-day retention interval, priming effects were unchanged; and (2) priming effects were as large for the words identified as "new" in the immediately preceding recognition test as they were for the words identified as "old." Priming effects in word-fragment completion may be mediated by a cognitive system other than episodic and semantic memory. (23 ref) ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2012 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

In Study 3, participants' estimates of how much they would spend at a restaurant were influenced by whether the restaurant was named {“Studio} 17” or {“Studio} 97.” These effects were not qualified by participants' expertise in the relevant domain (Study 1) or by their ability to subsequently recall the anchor value (Study 3).

Several smaller studies have examined compliance in {HF}, but all were limited as they only studied either the individual components of compliance and its related factors or several aspects of compliance without studying the related factors. The aims of this study were to examine all dimensions of compliance and its related factors in one {HF} population.
Methods and results Data were collected in a cohort of 501 {HF} patients. Clinical and demographic data were assessed and patients completed questionnaires on compliance, beliefs, knowledge, and self-care behaviour. Overall compliance was 72\% in this older {HF} population. Compliance with medication and appointment keeping was high ({\textgreater}90\%). In contrast, compliance with diet (83\%), fluid restriction (73\%), exercise (39\%), and weighing (35\%) was markedly lower. Compliance was related to knowledge ({OR=5.67;} {CI} 2.87–11.19), beliefs ({OR=1.78;} {CI} 1.18–2.69), and depressive symptoms ({OR=0.53;} {CI} 0.35–0.78).
Conclusion Although some aspects of compliance had an acceptable level, compliance with weighing and exercise were low. In order to improve compliance, an increase of knowledge and a change of patient's beliefs by education and counselling are recommended. Extra attention should be paid to patients with depressive symptoms.},

The public knows too little science, it is claimed, to understand the evidence or avoid being misled. Widespread limits on technical reasoning aggravate the problem by forcing citizens to use unreliable cognitive heuristics to assess risk. We conducted a study to test this account and found no support for it. Members of the public with the highest degrees of science literacy and technical reasoning capacity were not the most concerned about climate change. Rather, they were the ones among whom cultural polarization was greatest. This result suggests that public divisions over climate change stem not from the public’s incomprehension of science but from a distinctive conflict of interest: between the personal interest individuals have in forming beliefs in line with those held by others with whom they share close ties and the collective one they all share in making use of the best available science to promote common welfare.},

	abstract = {The widespread prevalence and persistence of misinformation in contemporary societies, such as the false belief that there is a link between childhood vaccinations and autism, is a matter of public concern. For example, the myths surrounding vaccinations, which prompted some parents to withhold immunization from their children, have led to a marked increase in vaccine-preventable disease, as well as unnecessary public expenditure on research and public-information campaigns aimed at rectifying the situation.
We first examine the mechanisms by which such misinformation is disseminated in society, both inadvertently and purposely. Misinformation can originate from rumors but also from works of fiction, governments and politicians, and vested interests. Moreover, changes in the media landscape, including the arrival of the Internet, have fundamentally influenced the ways in which information is communicated and misinformation is spread.
We next move to misinformation at the level of the individual, and review the cognitive factors that often render misinformation resistant to correction. We consider how people assess the truth of statements and what makes people believe certain things but not others. We look at people’s memory for misinformation and answer the questions of why retractions of misinformation are so ineffective in memory updating and why efforts to retract misinformation can even backfire and, ironically, increase misbelief. Though ideology and personal worldviews can be major obstacles for debiasing, there nonetheless are a number of effective techniques for reducing the impact of misinformation, and we pay special attention to these factors that aid in debiasing.
We conclude by providing specific recommendations for the debunking of misinformation. These recommendations pertain to the ways in which corrections should be designed, structured, and applied in order to maximize their impact. Grounded in cognitive psychological theory, these recommendations may help practitioners—including journalists, health professionals, educators, and science communicators—design effective misinformation retractions, educational tools, and public-information campaigns.},

	isbn = {9781596916104},
	shorttitle = {Merchants of Doubt},
	abstract = {The {U.S.} scientific community has long led the world in research on such areas as public health, environmental science, and issues affecting quality of life. Our scientists have produced landmark studies on the dangers of {DDT}, tobacco smoke, acid rain, and global warming. But at the same time, a small yet potent subset of this community leads the world in vehement denial of these dangers.   Merchants of Doubt tells the story of how a loose-knit group of high-level scientists and scientific advisers, with deep connections in politics and industry, ran effective campaigns to mislead the public and deny well-established scientific knowledge over four decades. Remarkably, the same individuals surface repeatedly-some of the same figures who have claimed that the science of global warming is "not settled" denied the truth of studies linking smoking to lung cancer, coal smoke to acid rain, and {CFCs} to the ozone hole. {"Doubt} is our product," wrote one tobacco executive. These "experts" supplied it.   Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway, historians of science, roll back the rug on this dark corner of the American scientific community, showing how ideology and corporate interests, aided by a too-compliant media, have skewed public understanding of some of the most pressing issues of our era.},
