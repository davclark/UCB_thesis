\chapter{Pencil-and-Paper Version of the Mechanism Intervention}
\label{app:mech-format}

On the pages that follow is a faithful reproduction of the core intervention
given to individuals in the no-pretest condition. The sandwich intervention
included an exact copy of the posttest as the pretest (note, it did note include
the “kinds of light” comprehension check). Both versions included page numbers
(omitted here to avoid confusion with dissertation page numbers). Finally, the
no-pretest survey included a brief set of open-ended questions that are not
reported on in this dissertation.

The online version was quite similar, with largely identical instructions (the
primary difference being the addition of some provisions for quitting the
experiment by closing the browser). In addition, online the survey items were
randomized, and a few more were added.
