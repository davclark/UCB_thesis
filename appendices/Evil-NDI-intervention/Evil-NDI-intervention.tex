\chapter{Format of \texorpdfstring{“Evil”}{"Evil"} NDI Intervention}
\label{app:format-ndi}

Below are the full instructions and examples only for our “evil” NDI intervention.
Interventions consisted of two interventions of the sort illustrated in the
following pages, or eight drastically simplified estimations. Note that the
following pages only include the “example” pages. The pages immediately
following each example followed the same format, but included numbers that
demonstrably eroded acceptance and concern for global warming (as described in
Chapter~\ref{chap:evilndi}).
