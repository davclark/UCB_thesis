\chapter{Using Imputation to Combine Participants with and without a Pretest}
\label{app:imputation}

Imputation is a well-established approach to dealing with missing data
\parencite[for an overview see][Chapter 20]{fox_applied_2008}. In a number of
the experiments in this dissertation, multiple groups received a similar
intervention, but one group may have been missing a pre-test where we obtained
their na\"ive baseline score (e.g., for a climate-relevant attitude). The
approach we used in these cases was to use the participants for which we
\emph{did} have a pre-test score (i.e., our sandwich group), and use the average
of those as an approximation to our other groups pre-test score. To be explicit,
following is the exact R code used to compute this test for Study 1 in
Chapter~\ref{chap:mechanism}:

% looks like we can have about 78 characters with Inconsolata, but thatâ€™s tight
\begin{minted}{r}
# Here, dfs is pre-populated with the measured values. We assign the mean of
# the sandwich (s) group scores to the pre-test scores for the no-pretest
# group (n). We then append the sandwich group scores unmodified.

imputed.df <- data.frame(pre.gw=mean(dfs$s.pre$total.gw),
                         total.gw=dfs$n.post$total.gw)

imputed.df <- rbind(imputed.df,
                    dfs$s.post[,c('pre.gw', 'total.gw')])

# Note - this gives the same result as a simple t-test on the difference
# scores, so we're not cheating on our degrees of freedom, or obtaining
# artificially lower variance on the pre-test scores.

with(imputed.df,
     t.test(pre.gw, total.gw, alternative='less', paired=TRUE) )
\end{minted}
