\chapter{Format of Representative-Number NDI Intervention}
\label{app:format-ndi}

Below is an example format for an NDI-style estimation intervention.  Unlike in
the “evil” NDI intervention, all participants encountered seven or eight such
estimations. Formatting of survey items was a straightforward translation to a
page with radio buttons. Note that I was unable to capture the actual formatting
of the web site used via the Qualtrics system. The general layout is correct,
however the color scheme was UC Berkeley themed. In particular that where
participants are asked to provide percent confidence, there is a slider for that
response.
