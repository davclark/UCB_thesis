\chapter{Numerical Information Used in Chapter~\ref{chap:prondi}}
\label{app:numbers}

Tables~\ref{table:pro-numbers1} and \ref{table:pro-numbers2} provide the wording
of the numerical information used in Studies 1 and 2 in
Chapter~\ref{chap:prondi}. These were not the only changes made, and for a more
complete description of the changes, please see
section~\ref{sec:CCO-ndi-methods}.

Note that we do not report the specific information used in
Chapter~\ref{chap:evilndi}, as we have little desire to contribute to the
precision of the already formidable propaganda campaign arrayed against climate
change acceptance.  However, below are the numerical items used in
Chapter~\ref{chap:prondi}.

because it is actualy not very impressive.} &
