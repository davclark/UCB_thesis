\chapter{Extension to Cohen's \texorpdfstring{$\kappa$}{kappa} for multiple scores}
\label{app:kappa}

Here, I'll describe exactly how I computed those $\kappa$'s for the mechanism
studies.

A note on using $\kappa$ in the text above: it seems completely admissable to
continue to use $\kappa$ for the measure described above, given it's similarity
in spirit to Cohen's original measure. This seems doubly admissable considering
that formal distributional considerations appear to be considered rarely, if
ever, in the psychological literature. Thus, any deviations in the specifics of
formal properties are unlikely to be a concern for the casual reader.
