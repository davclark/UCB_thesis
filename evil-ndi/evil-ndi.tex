\chapter{Learning \texorpdfstring{``Evil''}{"Evil"} Non-Representative
    Climate-Related Numbers}
\label{chap:evilndi}

The Numerically Driven Inferencing (NDI) paradigm is introduced in
Section~\ref{sec:ndi}. In Chapter~\ref{chap:two}, we
see that surprising numerical information can have a lasting impact on an
individual's conception of a politically relevant number---sometimes even without
conscious recollection of the experience that catalyzed this change.  Below, we
will see that misleading, cherry-picked numerical facts can have a marked shift
on individuals' beliefs and policy preferences. This result serves as a
call-to-arms for climate educators, as even relatively well-educated, liberal,
Global Warming (GW) accepting students are highly susceptible to the kinds of information
currently being used to undermine acceptance of climate change.

\section{Overview}

As described in Section~\ref{sec:comm-strategies},
there is some debate surrounding the value of scientific or numeric information
regarding climate change. Indeed, some have claimed that such interventions will
only serve to polarize individuals, thus making the situation worse than it
already is. However, some organizations publish out-of-context facts to try to
undercut the reality or gravity of human-caused climate change. Such numbers are
often blatantly cherry picked. For example, one can locate GW deniers who note
that the Earth’s temperature decreased (by 0.2°F) from 1940 to 1975
\parencite{jastrow_global_1991}. This surprising fact, though, hardly
contradicts the ever more obvious warming trend over the last 125+ years---one
can pluck many ``trends'' in noisy time series by picking endpoints that are
oddly high or low. Given this rather clear intent to mislead
\parencite[corroborated by][]{oreskes_merchants_2010}, we (partly
tongue-in-cheek) label these numbers ``evil.'' 

Our three hypotheses were that misleading facts would reduce:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item participants’ climate change acceptance, 
    \item ratings of their knowledge of the issue, and 
    \item their climate-change-related funding preferences.
\end{enumerate}
Of course, lest we would have eroded participants’ acceptance of anthropogenic
climate change more than fleetingly, we debriefed them right afterward with more
complete information---including a large dose of representative numerical facts
as well as the basic physical mechanism of GW (the mechanism is detailed in full
in Chapter~\ref{chap:mechanism}). It should be clear that we're not interested
in perfecting an approach to eroding acceptance of the overwhelming scientific
consensus on climate change! 

In this Chapter, we'll see easily obtained and dramatic effects with an NDI
intervention using cherry-picked numbers that appear to contradict the veracity
of anthropogenic climate change (when considered in isolation). There is only
one experiment reported, with the intent of determining whether these materials
would drive meaningful changes. In particular, we administered this experiment
only to undergraduate seminar courses in which we could be sure to administer a
proper debriefing.

\section{Study: UCB Lecture Intervention with \texorpdfstring{“Evil”}{"Evil"}
    Numbers}

\subsection{Methods} 
\label{sec:evilndi-methods}

\subsubsection{Participants}
\label{sec:evil-participants}

Two lecture courses of UC Berkeley undergraduates (spanning cognitive science and
“Behavioral Change”) were engaged in this intervention ($N=104$). 59 students
completed the 8-item “no pretest” version of the experiment and 45 completed
the 2-item full EPIC intervention. All participants were retained after
examining the coherence of survey responses.

In the 8-item intervention, 34 participants were female and mean conservativism
of 3.64 (on a 1--9 scale; $sd=1.59$) was observed. In the 2-item intervention,
31 participants were female and mean conservativism was 3.68 ($sd=1.43$).
Breakdown of political party is given in Table~\ref{table:evil-party}.

\subsubsection{Materials and Procedure}

Participants were engaged in one of two misleading numeracy
interventions (depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:evil-flow}). In both versions, survey
methods were as described in Chapter~\ref{chap:survey}. This study utilized a
somewhat compact version of a pre and post-intervention test using only the 14
items in Table~\ref{table:rtmd-questions} in the Appendix (up through
\textsf{engage}, and in the order given in that table), plus a self-rating of
climate-change knowledge (for a total of 15).  After the intervention, all
participants also completed a brief demographic survey.  A reproduction of the
actual format of the survey is provided in Appendix~\ref{app:format-ndi}.
Notable demographic results from this survey are reported directly above, under
“Participants.”

\begin{figure}[h]
    \includegraphics[width=6.5in]{evil-ndi-survey-flow.pdf}
    \caption{An overview of experimental procedures for our “evil” NDI
        experiment. If we consider our EPIC or EI interventions to be “jam,” and
        our surveys to be slices of bread, we see that the participants in the
        2-item condition received a full “sandwich.” (Participants in the 8-item
        condition received no pretest).  Flow for NDI experiments in
        Chapter~\ref{chap:prondi} had a full “sandwich” structure, but used the
        condensed EI intervention style from the 8-item intervention (based on
        the results we'll see below, in which the 8-item intervention elicited
        much larger changes in our measures).}
    \label{fig:evil-flow}
\end{figure}

In the “no pretest blast” version of the intervention, participants estimated
each of eight items prior to receiving the feedback values, with an emphasis on
maximizing the quantity of feedback numbers presented to the participant. To
this end, this eight-item survey included only a posttest (i.e., no pretest),
and lacked a policy component (thus, it was an EI intervention, lacking ``P'' or
``C,'' similar to the approach used in Chapter~\ref{chap:two}). 

A more comprehensive engagement containing only two items was administered to
the rest of the class. This version included a pretest and additional questions
about each item. In addition, we asked students about their surprise level after
each feedback value and requested both their climate-change funding Policies and
post-feedback policy Changes versus various United Nations Development Project
(UNDP) millennium goals.  Thus, this
latter variant was a full EPIC intervention. The same set of alternatives was
used across the four variants of the 2-item intervention, and these are listed
along with policy-relevant instructions in Appendix~\ref{app:undp}. (The
format of this part of the intervention is given in
Appendix~\ref{app:format-ndi}, but the specific pages with the “evil” numbers
have been redacted, as we wish to withhold the text of the numerical
materials to avoid spreading misleading information.)

Note that while this experiment is presented first as a motivation for the
following chapters, it was actually carried out \emph{after} a number of
experiments in Chapters~\ref{chap:prondi} and \ref{chap:mechanism}. Thus, a
number of experimental design choices made here are motivated by findings from
experiments in those chapters.

\subsection{Results}

Overall, these numbers had a profound impact, the details of which are described
below. As with other NDI interventions
\parencite[e.g.,][]{ranney_designing_2008}, and consistent with our pilot testing,
individuals generally found each of these items surprising, ranging from
surprise ratings of 5.83 to 8.53 across both interventions. Mean surprise
ratings were 6.03 for the 2-item intervention and 6.62 for the 8-item
intervention. Ratings were on a 1--9 scale, with all ratings above “1”
indicating some level of surprise.

\subsubsection{Shifts Away from GW Policy Preferences}

As hypothesized, policy preferences for funding goals related to climate
change dropped ($\chi^2(1)=22$, $p<0.01$) for both funding questions across all
eight numbers (the funding policies are described in Appendix~\ref{app:undp}).
Unfortunately for global warming as a social priority, the highest mean pretest
preference for funding climate change initiatives reached only a 50-50 split of
available funds. These results are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:evil-alloc}.
While, due to time constraints, we did not include funding qeustions to check
for a similar result in our 8-item intervention, it seems likely that similar
(or greater) shifts would occur along with the much more drastic GW attitude
shifts we'll see below.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{evil-alloc.pdf}
    \caption{Significant drops in preference for allocation of \$100M towards
        climate-related projects on “UN Advisor” task ($p<5\times10^{-6}$). The
        two policy decisions are detailed in Appendix~\ref{app:undp}. Each of
        the four survey variants is represented by a different color (each
        variant utilized two of the eight numerical estimation items used in
        this study). The two policy choices remained the same in each variant
        (and are indicated by solid versus dashed lines). Values are expressed
        as a percentage of funds that were allocated to climate-relevant
        projects versus projects supporting an alternative UNDP millennium
        goal.}
    \label{fig:evil-alloc}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{GW acceptance eroded by misleading numbers}

Also, as hypothesized, mean climate change acceptance dropped significantly,
from 6.5 on the pretest to 6.2 on the posttest for the two-item condition (6\%
of available room, for a 9-point scale, $t(42)=-4.3$, $p<0.001$), and
significantly to 5.9 for the eight-item condition (12\% of available room,
$t(88.6)=‑2.61$, $p<0.005$).  Note that these shifts were also in the direction
of ambivalence (a ``5'' rating), and may reflect confusion rather than
disagreement. Mean ratings are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:evil-GW}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{evil-GW.pdf}
    \caption{Mean ratings for GW survey items on pre and posttest. Pretest
        surveys were only administered for the 2-item condition, but should be
        indicative of population responses. Error bars represent standard errors
        for each measure.}
    \label{fig:evil-GW}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Self-confidence in GW knowledge eroded by misleading numbers}

Our third hypothesis was also supported, as self-rated knowledge dropped from a
mean of 5.0 on the pretest to 4.5 for the two-item condition (12\% of available
room, $t(44)=-2.5$, $p<0.01$), and plummeted to 2.9 on eight-item survey
($t(87.2)=-5.3$, $p<0.001$). This latter decrease, 2.1, represents 53\% of the
available room to drop on a 9-point scale, which is exceptionally large. These
ratings are depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:evil-know}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{evil-know.pdf}
    \caption{Self-rated knowledge for individuals on pre and posttests. Again,
        pretests were only administered to individuals in the 2-item
        experimental variant.}
    \label{fig:evil-know}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Discussion}

In stark contrast to arguments that numeracy is polarizing
\parencite[e.g.,][]{kahan_polarizing_2012}, we have provided an existence proof that
appropriately selected scientific facts can have a profound effect in eroding
the existing beliefs of a population (i.e., “liberals” can be pushed in a more
“conservative” direction). In particular, we have demonstrated marked erosion of
self-confidence in one's own knowledge, as well as acceptance and concern regarding
anthropogenic climate change---even in our relatively liberal and
anthropogenic-climate-change-accepting sample of UC Berkeley undergraduates.
Such results were observed with as little as \emph{two} numbers.
Consider the effect of Richard Muller's writings prior to \textcite{rohde_new_2013}. A
prominent professor at our ostensibly liberal institution wrote extensively on
why we should doubt the veracity of climate change---including in the mainstream
media. We must assume that educated, liberal, GW-accepting individuals may be
easily swayed by a small dose of factual (but non-representative) numerical or
scientific information from such a source.

The primary point illustrated by this study is that individuals' understandings
are demonstrably fragile. Even an intervention of a few minutes can massively
undercut individuals' confidence in their own knowledge, along with overall
belief and concern about global climate change. An additional point is that---as
noted by \textcite{kahan_polarizing_2012} and
\textcite{mccright_politicization_2011}---if we survey individuals with high
scientific literacy, who are likely to have been self-guided in their
climate-relevant education, such education appears to be polarizing. Thus, one
might conclude that climate change accepters are unlikely to come into contact
with numbers like the ones in this study on their own.  However, there are
concerted efforts to distribute such numbers on the internet and elsewhere. A
final point is that, as shown above and as noted by
\textcite{mccright_politicization_2011}, scientific information might push
individuals both towards scientific consensus, as well as \emph{away} from it.
Thus, overall, it seems wise to build a solid foundation of climate-change-relevant
knowledge in the American populace. 

It is clear that even relatively educated members of the public (e.g.,
undergraduates at a top-tier university) are highly susceptible to misleading,
cherry picked facts. Such facts are clearly known to organizations attempting to
undermine the overwhelming scientific consensus about climate change. Thus,
climate educators and communicators must counter the increasing sophistication
with which such organizations distribute misleading information.
