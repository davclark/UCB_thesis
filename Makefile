# The thesis itself. We move the PDF to a new filename so that viewers
# don't keep on trying to reload the file as it's being written and
# rewritten by pdfLaTeX. Instead we pseudo-atomically rename after all
# the processing is done. (You might think that a 'mv' would be the
# way to do this, but on Linux, Evince doesn't try to reload the file
# that it's currently looking at unless the file gets opened in write
# mode and closed, so we 'cp' instead.)
