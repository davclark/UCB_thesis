the narrative, failing to integrate critical quantitative information effectively. The Numerically 
Driven Inferencing {(NDI)} paradigm’s research (e.g., Ranney et al., 2001; Munnich, Ranney, 
\& Appel, 2004) suggested that a curricular module highlighting evidential/scientific thinking 
might enhance reporters’ quantitative and analytic skills.  The resulting controlled experiment 
involved 55 first-year journalism graduate students, our {“Numbers}, News, and Evidence” 
module, 4.5 classroom hours, 20 homework hours, and several  (e.g., Pre-, Mid- and Final- 
test) assessments. Post-module findings indicate success: Relative to control data, the 
experimental group improved on the main numeracy measures: 1) estimation accuracy and 2) 
math competence involving simple problem solving, data analyses, and exponential growth. 
Students and faculty both concluded that future students should also receive numeracy 
modules.  The module apparently influenced students’ attitudes about numerical information, 
too.  The collective results may benefit journalists, their instructors, and media consumers.},

found that people are often poor at estimating base rates.
Going beyond past research, we further found that many are
quite surprised by the true base rates, and readily revise their
numerical preferences after receiving them. Preference
changes seem surprise-mediated and are often actual policy
shifts (which go beyond the mere re-scaling of preferences in
proportion to the feedback). The shifts suggest that conceptual
changes among a network of propositions gave rise to belief
revisions. We also found that abortion rates queried in differ-

changes. {EPIC} may be used to improve numeracy, so we also
discuss an {NDI} curriculum that engages younger people; it
may allow us to further consider how numerical cognition and

92 undergraduates offered estimates and preferences for the

receiving the (usually, quite surprising) true rate as feedback,
they provided another (typically changed) preference-and-

abortion rate, and largely advocated decreases in it––both pre-
and post-feedback. Feedback caused most of those who
initially wanted no change in the abortion rate both to
abandon the status quo and change preference-justifications;
after feedback, two thirds of these students preferred a rate
decrease, while the rest preferred an increase. Although many
researchers hold that belief revision and conceptual change
are quite difficult to elicit, these and other results show
dramatic effects of simple base rate feedback on policy
evaluation. Our findings highlight the importance of having

to study numerically-based reasoning that includes the
subjective natures of our personal beliefs and social lives.},

	abstract = {Novel word learning is central to the flexibility inherent in the human language capacity. Word learning may partially depend on long-term memory formation during the assembly of phonological representations from orthographic inputs. In the present study, event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging {(fMRI)} examined the contributions of phonological control-a component of the verbal working memory system-to phonological assembly and word learning. Subjects were scanned while making syllable decisions about visually presented familiar {(English)} and novel {(pseudo-English} and Foreign) words, a task that required retrieval and analysis of existing phonological codes or the assembly and analysis of novel representations. Results revealed that left inferior prefrontal cortex {(LIPC)} and bilateral parietal cortices were differentially engaged during the processing of novel words, suggesting that this circuit is recruited during phonological assembly. A subsequent memory analysis that examined the relation between {fMRI} signal and the subject's ability to later remember the words (a measure of effective memory formation) revealed that the magnitude of activation in {LIPC}, bilateral superior parietal, and left inferior parietal cortices was positively correlated with later memory. Moreover, although the magnitude of the subsequent memory effect in parietal cortex was not significantly affected by word type, this effect was greater in posterior {LIPC} for novel {(pseudo-English)} than for familiar {(English)} words. In the course of subserving the assembly of novel word representations, the phonological (articulatory) control component of the phonological system appears to play a central role in the encoding of novel words into long-term memory.},

In experiments using a hippocampal-dependent paired-associate task for rats, the memory of flavor-place associations became persistent over time as a putative neocortical schema gradually developed. New traces, trained for only one trial, then became assimilated and rapidly hippocampal-independent. Schemas also played a causal role in the creation of lasting associative memory representations during one-trial learning.

	abstract = {The relationship between implicit and explicit processes during motor learning, and for visuomotor adaptation in particular, is poorly understood. We set up a conflict between implicit and explicit processes by instructing subjects to counter a visuomotor rotation using a cognitive strategy in a pointing task. Specifically, they were told the exact nature of the directional perturbation, a rotation that directed them 45degrees counterclockwise from the desired target, and they were instructed to counter it by aiming for the neighboring clockwise target, 45degrees away. Subjects were initially successful in completely negating the rotation with this strategy. Surprisingly, however, they were unable to sustain explicit control and made increasingly large errors to the desired target. The cognitive strategy failed because subjects simultaneously adapted unconsciously to the rotation to the neighboring target. Notably, the rate of implicit adaptation to the neighboring target was not significantly different from rotation adaptation in the absence of an opposing explicit strategy. These results indicate that explicit strategies cannot substitute for implicit adaptation to a visuomotor rotation and are in fact overridden by the motor planning system. This suggests that the motor system requires that planned and executed trajectories remain congruous in visual space, and enforces this correspondence even at the expense of an opposing explicit task goal. {10.1523/JNEUROSCI.5317-05.2006}},

Although the medial temporal lobe (which includes the hippocampus and surrounding perirhinal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal cortices) is known to be crucial for recognition memory, controversy remains regarding how the specific subregions within the medial temporal lobe contribute to recognition. We used event-related functional {MRI} to examine the relation between activation in distinct medial temporal lobe subregions during memory formation and the ability (i) to later recognize an item as previously encountered (item recognition) and (ii) to later recollect specific contextual details about the prior encounter (source recollection). Encoding activation in hippocampus and in posterior parahippocampal cortex predicted later source recollection, but was uncorrelated with item recognition. In contrast, encoding activation in perirhinal cortex predicted later item recognition, but not subsequent source recollection. These outcomes suggest that the subregions within the medial temporal lobe subserve distinct, but complementary, learning mechanisms. 10.1073/pnas.0337195100},

Experiment 1 uses a {Numerically-Driven} Inferencing {(NDI)}
paradigm method in which participants estimated policy-
relevant quantities, learned the true quantities, and rated their
surprise regarding that feedback. When asked to recall the
quantities either eight or 84 days post-feedback, participants
improved the most over their original estimates on items that
surprised them the most. In Experiment 2, we found that a
measure of prospective surprise (“shock”; Ranney, Cheng,
Nelson, \& Garcia de Osuna, 2001)—derived from an interval
in which participants believed the number fell, and
participants’ confidence that the number fell in that interval—
reliably predicted retrospective surprise ratings like those in
Experiment 1. We conclude that surprise is a rather stable
construct about which people have considerable
metacognition. Future work in this area may suggest how
leaders, voters, and consumers can best employ their

	abstract = {Motor learning is a ubiquitous feature of human competence. This review focuses on two particular classes of model tasks for studying skill acquisition. The serial reaction time {(SRT)} task is used to probe how people learn sequences of actions, while adaptation in the context of visuomotor or force field perturbations serves to illustrate how preexisting movements are recalibrated in novel environments. These tasks highlight important issues regarding the representational changes that occur during the course of motor learning. One important theme is that distinct mechanisms vary in their information processing costs during learning and performance. Fast learning processes may require few trials to produce large changes in performance but impose demands on cognitive resources. Slower processes are limited in their ability to integrate complex information but minimally demanding in terms of attention or processing resources. The representations derived from fast systems may be accessible to conscious processing and provide a relatively greater measure of flexibility, while the representations derived from slower systems are more inflexible and automatic in their behavior. In exploring these issues, we focus on how multiple neural systems may interact and compete during the acquisition and consolidation of new behaviors.},

	abstract = {Conceptual change represents a crucial, challenging, learning component. This study 
hypothesized and observed evidence for two parallel forms of learning within the {Numerically-Driven} 
Inferencing {(NDI)} paradigm’s rather minimalist intervention of providing direct feedback regarding a 
numerical estimate––feedback that yields remarkably robust cognitive alterations. The present 
experiment probed the nature of learning apropos recall or estimation improvements observed after 
participants (a) provided estimates, (b) received feedback, and (c) re-estimated after waiting for one 
day. The results show that improved estimation/recall was predicted by two independent elements–– 
surprise at feedback and an explicit sense of episodic recall upon testing. This suggests at least two 
learning processes: (1) an explicit (though perhaps approximate) recollection of a quantity’s magnitude 
and (2) a non-episodic semantic restructuring that correlates with surprise. Thus, even for concise, 
factual information, we educators might consider students’ “unknown knowns”––knowledge that 
learners gain without any explicit understanding that they have done so.},
