\begin{abstract}

Climate change\footnote{A term that is preferred over “Global Warming.” Even
    though changes in atmospheric chemistry will force the mean temperature of
    the globe higher, the effects will complicated by climate systems, resulting
    in local cooling in some places and a variety of other changes in weather
    patterns.} is easily one of the most pressing concerns of our time, and its
solution will come about only through a change in human behavior. Americans are
some of the least accepting of the realities of climate change worldwide. In
order to address this concern in a free society, U.S. citizens must be convinced
or coerced to take the necessary actions. Sadly, climate communicators appear to
be settling on the notion that emotional persuasion is superior to education.

We'll begin by reviewing an experiment in the Numerically Driven Inferencing
(NDI) paradigm that sheds some light on the cognitive processes involved in
learning and attitude shifts in response to surprising policy-relevant
information.  From there, we proceed to specifically tackle climate-related
attitudes and beliefs in the United States.  Some empirical approaches
(including some of our own) indicate that U.S.  citizens generally accept
anthropogenic\footnote{I.e., “human caused.”} climate change, and support action
on this issue. We'll first establish that these beliefs and attitudes are
disturbingly fragile in the face of cherry-picked, misleading numerical facts.
We will then see that representative numerical facts can effectively increase
climate change acceptance and concern, but only if carefully presented in an
unconfusing manner. Such information, however, continues to surprise and
undermine students' confidence in their own knowledge.  Finally, we will see
that by providing an a coherent explanation of the mechanism of climate change
that includes relevant numerical facts provides support not only for beliefs and
attitudes, but also leaves students feeling that they know more than they did
prior to instruction.  These shifts are durable, and point the way towards
effective curricula and on-line materials to help bolster support to combat
climate change.
