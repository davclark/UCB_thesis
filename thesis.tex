% The above command prevents latex from writing its auxiliary

% This is one approach to doing maths with the modern opentype font approach
% These are options that don't matter to this document!
% \usepackage[partial=upright,nabla=upright]{unicode-math}
% Note that none of the 4 styles available in unicode-math adhere to APA! french
% is closest / easiest, as only upright latin characters are wrong (they should

% microtype enables subtle typography improvements.
% Note that in XeTeX, expansion is disabled, and so some line breaks get screwed

% Page layout. The fancyhdr package may complain about the need for a
% larger headheight, depending on how long chapter titles are; if left
% unspecified in the geometry setup, it defaults to 12pt. The

% show a frame around the margins on every page, which is great for
% checking that you don't overflow anywhere.

It was typeset with \hologo{LuaLaTeX} using fonts from the \TeX\ Gyre project
(primarily Pagella). The research reported here was supported in part by the
